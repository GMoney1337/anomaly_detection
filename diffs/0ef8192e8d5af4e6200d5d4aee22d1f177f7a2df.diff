 XZ Utils Release Notes
 ======================
 
+5.4.6 (2024-01-26)
+
+    * Fixed a bug involving internal function pointers in liblzma not

+        - Fixed a regression introduced in 5.4.2 that caused encoding
+          in the raw format to unnecessarily fail if --suffix was not

+          that --suffix must be used:
+
+              echo foo | xz --format=raw --lzma2 | wc -c
+

+
+    * Added a new test.
