-/// \todo       Crypto++ has x86 ASM optimizations. They use SSE so if they
-///             are imported to liblzma, SSE instructions need to be used
-///             conditionally to keep the code working on older boxes.

-//  This code is based on the code found from 7-Zip, which has a modified
-//  version of the SHA-256 found from Crypto++ <https://www.cryptopp.com/>.
-//  The code was modified a little to fit into liblzma.
+//  The C code is based on the public domain SHA-256 code found from
+//  Crypto++ Library 5.5.1 released in 2007: https://www.cryptopp.com/
+//  A few minor tweaks have been made in liblzma.
