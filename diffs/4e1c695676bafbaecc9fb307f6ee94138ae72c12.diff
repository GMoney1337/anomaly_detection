-                There is limited sandboxing support in the xz tool. If
-                built with sandbox support, it's used automatically when

-                the options --files or --files0 weren't used. This is a
-                common use case, for example, (de)compressing .tar.xz
-                files via GNU tar. The sandbox is also used for

+                xzdec always uses the sandbox, except when more than one
