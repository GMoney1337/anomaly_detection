-LZMA Utils Licenses
--------------------
+XZ Utils Licensing
+==================
 
     Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
-    is a rough summary of which license apply to which parts of this
+    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
     package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
-      - Everything under src/liblzma/check and tests/files is public
-        domain.
-      - Everything else under the src directory is under the GNU LGPL
-        2.1 or (at your opinion) any later version.
-      - Outside the src directory, there are some files that are under
-        the GNU GPL 2 or (at your opinion) any later version, or under
-        the GNU GPL 3 or (at your opinion) any later version.
-      - Most documentation files are under an all-permissive license.
-
-    The following license texts are included in the following files
-    in this package:
+
+      - liblzma is in the public domain.
+
+      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
+        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
+        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
+        GNU LGPLv2.1+.
+
+      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
+        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
+        under GNU GPLv2+.
+
+      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
+        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
+        are in the public domain.
+
+      - Translated messages are in the public domain.
+
+      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
+        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
+        in the binaries being built.
+
+      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
+        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
+
+      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
+        that are under various free software licenses.
+
+    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
+    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
+    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
+    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
+    lawyers.
+
+    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
+    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
+    polite, but naturally it is not legally required.
+
+    As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
+
+    The following license texts are included in the following files:
       - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
       - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
       - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
 
-    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the copyright holder(s)
-    for more information.
+    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
+    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
+    binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
+    even though it contains no copyrighted code from this package.
+
+    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
+    information.

+XZ Utils FAQ
+============
 
 Q:  What are LZMA, LZMA Utils, lzma, .lzma, liblzma, LZMA SDK, LZMA_Alone,
     7-Zip and p7zip?
@@ -198,32 +191,7 @@ A:  BCJ filter is called "x86" in liblzma. BCJ2 is not included,
 
 Q:  Can I use LZMA in proprietary, non-free applications?
 
-A:  liblzma is under the GNU LGPL version 2.1 or (at your opinion) any
-    later version. To summarise (*NOTE* This summary is not legally
-    binding, that is, it doesn't give you any extra permissions compared
-    to the LGPL. Read the GNU LGPL carefully for the exact license
-    conditions.):
-      * All the changes made into the library itself must be published
-        under the same license.
-      * End users must be able to replace the used liblzma. Easiest way
-        to assure this is to link dynamically against liblzma so users
-        can replace the shared library file if they want.
-      * You must make it clear to your users, that your application uses
-        liblzma, and that liblzma is free software under the GNU LGPL.
-        A copy of GNU LGPL must be included.
-
-    LZMA SDK contains a special exception which allows linking *unmodified*
-    code statically with a non-free application. This exception does *not*
-    apply to liblzma.
-
-    As an alternative, you can support the development of LZMA and 7-Zip
-    by buying a proprietary license from Igor Pavlov. See homepage of
-    LZMA SDK <http://7-zip.org/sdk.html> for more information. Note that
-    having a proprietary license from Igor Pavlov doesn't allow you to use
-    liblzma in a way that contradicts with the GNU LGPL, because liblzma
-    contains code that is not copyrighted by Igor Pavlov. Please contact
-    both Lasse Collin and Igor Pavlov if the license conditions of liblzma
-    are not suitable for you.
+A:  Yes. See the file COPYING for details.

+ * a zlib-like API. The native file format is .xz, but also the old .lzma
+ * format and raw (no headers) streams are supported. Multiple compression
+ * algorithms (filters) are supported. Currently LZMA2 is the primary filter.
