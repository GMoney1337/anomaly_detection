 4. Translating the xz tool
 --------------------------
 
-    The messages from the xz tool have been translated into a few
-    languages. Before starting to translate into a new language, ask
-    the author whether someone else hasn't already started working on it.
+    The translations are handled via the Translation Project. If you
+    wish to help translating xz, please join the Translation Project:
 
-    Test your translation. Testing includes comparing the translated
-    output to the original English version by running the same commands
-    in both your target locale and with LC_ALL=C. Ask someone to
-    proof-read and test the translation.
+        https://translationproject.org/html/translators.html
 
-    Testing can be done e.g. by installing xz into a temporary directory:
