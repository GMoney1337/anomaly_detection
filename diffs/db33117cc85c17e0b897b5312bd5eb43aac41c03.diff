 # SYNOPSIS

+#   AX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
 #
 # DESCRIPTION
 #
-#   This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads.
-#   It sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and
-#   linker flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special
-#   C compiler flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain
-#   compiler flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment
-#   variables.)

+#   flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
+#   flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)
 #
 #   Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
-#   multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise).
-#   (This is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)

+#   is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
 #
-#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these
-#   flags, but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link
-#   with $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS
-#   $LIBS
+#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
+#   but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with
+#   $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS
 #
-#   If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use
-#   these variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
+#   If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these

 #
-#   In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute
-#   constant has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to
-#   that name (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
+#   In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
+#   has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
+#   (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
 #
-#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads
-#   library is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to
-#   run it if it is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the
-#   default action will define HAVE_PTHREAD.

-#   Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or
-#   if you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based
-#   on work by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/)
-#   (with help from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread
-#   macros posted by Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro
-#   repository. We are also grateful for the helpful feedback of
-#   numerous users.
