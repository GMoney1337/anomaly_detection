     * Added basic Codespell support to help catch typo errors.
 
 
+5.4.7 (2024-05-29)
+
+    * Not changed: Memory sanitizer (MSAN) has a false positive
+      in the CRC CLMUL code which also makes OSS Fuzz unhappy.
+      Valgrind is smarter and doesn't complain.
+
+      A revision to the CLMUL code is coming anyway and this issue
+      will be cleaned up as part of it. It won't be backported to
+      5.6.x or 5.4.x because the old code isn't wrong. There is
+      no reason to risk introducing regressions in old branches
+      just to silence a false positive.
+
+    * liblzma:
+
+        - lzma_index_decoder() and lzma_index_buffer_decode(): Fix
+          a missing output pointer initialization (*i = NULL) if the
+          functions are called with invalid arguments. The API docs
+          say that such an initialization is always done. In practice
+          this matters very little because the problem can only occur
+          if the calling application has a bug and these functions
+          return LZMA_PROG_ERROR.
+
+        - lzma_str_to_filters(): Fix a missing output pointer
+          initialization (*error_pos = 0). This is very similar
+          to the fix above.
+
+        - Fix C standard conformance with function pointer types.
+          This newly showed up with Clang 17 with -fsanitize=undefined.
+          There are no bug reports about this.
+
+        - Fix building with NVIDIA HPC SDK.
+
+    * xz:
+
+        - Fix a C standard conformance issue in --block-list parsing
+          (arithmetic on a null pointer).
+
+        - Fix a warning from GNU groff when processing the man page:
+          "warning: cannot select font 'CW'"
+
+        - Fix outdated threading related information on the man page.
+
+    * xzless:
+
+        - With "less" version 451 and later, use "||-" instead of "|-"
+          in the environment variable LESSOPEN. This way compressed
+          files that contain no uncompressed data are shown correctly
+          as empty.
+
+        - With "less" version 632 and later, use --show-preproc-errors
+          to make "less" show a warning on decompression errors.
+
+    * Autotools-based build system (configure):
+
+        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden with
+          --enable-symbol-versions. Documentation in INSTALL was
+          updated to match.
+
+    CMake:
+
+        - Linux on MicroBlaze is handled specially now. This matches
+          the changes made to the Autotools-based build in XZ Utils
+          5.4.2 and 5.2.11.
+
+        - Disable symbol versioning on non-glibc Linux to match what
+          the Autotools build does. For example, symbol versioning
+          isn't enabled with musl.
+
+        - Symbol versioning variant can now be overridden by setting
+          SYMBOL_VERSIONING to "OFF", "generic", or "linux".
+
+    * Documentation:
+
+        - Clarify the description of --disable-assembler in INSTALL.
+          The option only affects 32-bit x86 assembly usage.
+
+        - Add doc/examples/11_file_info.c. It was added to the
+          Git repository in 2017 but forgotten to be added into
+          distribution tarballs.
+
+        - Don't install the TODO file as part of the documentation.
+          The file is out of date.
+
+        - Update home page URLs back to their old locations on
+          tukaani.org.
+
+        - Update maintainer info.
