+The manifest enables support for path names longer than 260 wide
+characters (UTF-16 code units) if the feature has been enabled in

+Note that UTF-8 encoded filenames can exceed MAX_PATH (260) bytes when
+the UTF-16 form is still within MAX_PATH wide characters. In this
+situation the application doesn't need to be long path aware: functions
+like _open() work with UTF-8 names that exceed MAX_PATH bytes if the
+wide character form stays within MAX_PATH wide characters. (MAX_PATH
+includes the terminating null character.)
