-The blocks are compressed independently from each other.
-.\" FIXME: Explain how to these can be used for random access and threading.
+The blocks are compressed independently from each other,

+This option is typically used to override the default

+The default

+Typically a good value is 2\-4 times

+Using

+less than the LZMA2 dictionary size is waste of RAM

+In single-threaded mode no block splitting is done by default.

+No size information is stored in block headers,
